# Multi-Class Image Classifier (CIFAR-10)

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to classify images of three distinct types of food using high tech deep learning and computer vision techniques. The project utilizes transfer learning with PyTorch to achieve an impressive very high accuracy of 96+% on the test set. The implementation is executed on Google Colab for efficient computation and easy accessibility.

Step-by-Step Guide to Deploy on GitHub
1. Create a GitHub Account
If you don't already have a GitHub account.
2. Install Git (if you don't have it installed)
If Git is not already installed on your machine, you can download it from here. Once installed, you can verify that it s working by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
bash
Copy code
git --version
3. Create a GitHub Repository
Log in to your GitHub account.
On the main GitHub page, click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
Name your repository (e.g., multi-class-image-classifier).
Choose public (so others can access it).
Optionally, add a description (e.g., "Multi-class image classifier with CIFAR-10 dataset").
Initialize the repository with a README file (optional).
Click Create repository.
4. Prepare Your Local Project Folder
On your local machine, ensure that your project folder (e.g., multi-class-image-classifier/) contains all the necessary files and folders, like:
train_model_cifar10.py
evaluate_model.py
preprocess_data.py
notebooks/
requirements.txt
README.md
5. Initialize Git in Your Local Project Folder
If your project folder is not already a Git repository, initialize it as one by navigating to your project folder and running:
bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/your/project-folder
git init
6. Add Your Files to Git
Add all the files in your project folder to Git by running the following command:
bash
Copy code
git add .
This command stages all your files (and subfolders) for commit.
7. Commit Your Files to Git
After staging the files, commit them with a meaningful message, like so:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit with model and code"
8. Connect Your Local Repo to GitHub
Go to your GitHub repository and copy the repository URL (it will look something like https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/multi-class-image-classifier.git).
In your terminal, connect your local repository to GitHub by running:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/multi-class-image-classifier.git
9. Push Your Code to GitHub
Now, push your code to GitHub with the following command:
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
This command pushes your code to the master branch of your GitHub repository. After this step, your code will be live on GitHub.
10. Verify Your Code on GitHub
Go to your GitHub repository URL in your browser (e.g., https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/multi-class-image-classifier).
You should see all your files and folders in the repository.

Extra Steps to Ensure Proper Structure and Functionality
Add a README.md file:
Ensure that your repository has a README.md file that explains:
How to reproduce results (e.g., how to run the training script or load the dataset).
Example README.md:

# Multi-Class Image Classifier (CIFAR-10)
This project implements a multi-class image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the CIFAR-10 dataset (or instructions for downloading).
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for training, evaluation, and preprocessing.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for training and experimentation.

## Requirements
To install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Code
Training the Model
Run the following script to train the model:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/train_model_cifar10.py
Evaluating the Model
After training, evaluate the model performance:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/evaluate_model.py
Results
The model achieves [insert accuracy] on the test set.
go
Copy code

2. **Add a `requirements.txt` file**:
   
This file is essential for others to install the required dependencies. For example, the `requirements.txt` could contain:

```txt
tensorflow==2.11.0
numpy==1.23.0
matplotlib==3.6.0
scikit-learn==1.1.2
To create requirements.txt, run:
bash
Copy code
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Create a LICENSE (optional):
If you want to include a license for your code, you can add a LICENSE file. You can choose a license from GitHub's licensing options.
Push Changes After Modifications:
If you make any changes to your local repository (e.g., adding more code or fixing bugs), repeat the following steps:
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push

How to Share Your GitHub Repository
Once your project is live on GitHub, you can share the repository link with others (e.g., your instructor). To get the link:
Go to your repository page.
Copy the URL from the browser's address bar.
For example: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/multi-class-image-classifier.

Summary of Key Commands
Initialize Git repository: git init
Add all files to Git: git add .
Commit files to Git: git commit -m "Your message"
Link to GitHub repository: git remote add origin <repository_url>
Push to GitHub: git push -u origin master
