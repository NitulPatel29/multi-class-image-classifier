# Multi-Class Image Classifier (CIFAR-10)

This project implements a multi-class image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the CIFAR-10 dataset (or instructions for downloading).
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for training, evaluation, and preprocessing.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for training and experimentation.

## Requirements
tensorflow==2.11.0
numpy==1.23.0
matplotlib==3.6.0
scikit-learn==1.1.2

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Code
Training the Model
Run the following script to train the model:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/train_model_cifar10.py
Evaluating the Model
After training, evaluate the model performance:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/evaluate_model.py
Results
